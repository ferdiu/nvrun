# Preferred bumblebee method
# If nvidia-xrun was installed along side with bumblebee 
# it means that if it was configured a *.desktop file to launch a program with
# primusrun or optirun, such *.desktop file could not be used when the
# session is started using nvidia-xrun. Use "nvrun" instead which will
# automatically choose between normal launc of the program or the bumblebee
# selected one.
# This variable should be either "primusrun" or "optirun"
# NB primusrun need packages primus, primus-nvidia and primus-libs
# https://www.bumblebee-project.org/install.html
# default = BUMBLEBEE_METHOD=primusrun
BUMBLEBEE_METHOD=primusrun

# When the selected bumblebee method is not executable nvrun can choose to
# fallback to the other method or just exit the script
# This could happen for example if primus was selected but not installed:
# in this case nvrun will try to launch the program with optirun instead
# 0 = exit the script on method not found
# 1 = try to execute with the other method
# default BUMBLEBEE_FALLBACK=1
BUMBLEBEE_FALLBACK=1

# If neither of the bumblebee method has been found choose if to fallback
# to integrated GPU or exit the program
# 0 = exit the script on method not found
# 1 = execute with integrated GPU
# default INTEGRATED_GPU_FALLBACK=0
INTEGRATED_GPU_FALLBACK=0
